# types-ragic-workflow

TypeScript type definitions for the Ragic JavaScript Workflow Engine, written based on the [official API documentation](https://www.ragic.com/intl/en/doc/15/javascript-workflow-engine) to provide IDE IntelliSense, more reliable type hints, and clearer inline documentation when authoring workflow scripts.

## What this package provides

- Ambient type declarations (`.d.ts`) for the Ragic Workflow runtime objects
- Commonly used Ragic workflow APIs and structures (as covered by the [official documentation](https://www.ragic.com/intl/en/doc/15/javascript-workflow-engine))

> Note: Ragic’s runtime environment is not a standard Node.js/browser runtime.

npm install -D types-ragic-workflow
